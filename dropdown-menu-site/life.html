                <h3>What the humans have to say about me:</h3>
                <p>
                    I was sadly left in front of the shelter by an 
                    irresponsible breeder, but thankfully, I was lucky 
                    enough to be the shelter's baby at the time! 
                    Everyone took such great care of me and showered 
                    me with lots of love. Now, it's almost been a year 
                    since I arrived, and as I grow older, 
                    I can't help but hope for my forever home.
