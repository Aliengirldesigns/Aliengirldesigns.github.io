        <h1>Strawberry Syrup From Scratch</h1>
        <p>
            Did you know it's so easy to make strawberry syrup from scratch?
            Of course you can use store-bought strawberry syrup like Torani 
            or even the Hershey's one used for ice cream sundaes. But it's 
            even better to make it yourself and it's super simple. You can 
            also use any syrup leftovers on pancakes, waffles, or ice cream.
        </p>
        <h3>Here are all the ingredients you need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Frozen Strawberries</h3></li>
            <li><h3>water</h3></li>
            <li><h3>granulated white sugar</h3></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The best part is it all comes together in one pot. Just add all the
            ingredients above to a pot and cook the strawberries down until 
            softened. You can also use fresh strawberries but frozen is easier!
            Once the strawberries are softened, mash them down, and 
            keep simmering until a thick syrup forms. Strain out the pulp and
            transfer the syrup to a jar.
        </p>
        <p>
            I definitely recommend having a handheld electric whisk to make 
            the process a lot easier and faster. Add the heavy cream, milk, 
            and vanilla extract. You can also add vanilla syrup instead of
            vanilla extract if you want it to be sweeter. Combine together 
            with the whisk until thick and airy. Mix in the strawberry syrup 
            now until it has a light pink hue and there you have strawberry 
            vanilla cold foam! It basically tastes like a 
            light strawberry milkshake.
        </p>
        <h1>Making the Drink</h1>
        <p>
            Now let's get to the actual coffee part! Start by brewing some 
            shots of espresso to make a latte. Get a large cup for iced drinks 
            and add the syrup to the bottom. You can either use white 
            mocha sauce like Starbucks does or use a regular 
            chocolate mocha sauce. You can also sweeten the drink with 
            vanilla syrup or whatever flavoring you like. 
            You can purchase white mocha sauce at the store or online 
            or just make the copycat version from the blog!
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have the desired amount of sauce/syrup, 
            add the shots of espresso and mix together to incorporate. 
            Then add ice and your milk of choice in a latte and top 
            with the strawberry cold foam. 
            This is completely optional but garnish the top with crushed 
            freeze-dried strawberries to enjoy!
