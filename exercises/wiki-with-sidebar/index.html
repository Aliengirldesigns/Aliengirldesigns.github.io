                    Mario Bros. features two plumbers,[5] Italian brothers Mario 
                    and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers after strange 
                    creatures have been appearing down there.[6] The objective 
                    of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. 
                    The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and 
                    jumping[7] Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump 
                    on enemies 
                    and squash them, unless they were already turned on their 
                    back.
                    [8] Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each 
                    corner of the screen, along with an object called a "POW" 
                    block in the center.[7] Phases use wraparound, meaning that 
                    enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on 
                    the opposite side.[9] Points are scored for defeating 
                    enemies 
                    and collecting the bonus coins that emerge from the pipes 
                    afterward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have 
                    been 
                    flipped on their back.[11] This is accomplished by hitting 
                    the 
                    platform the enemy is on directly beneath them.
                    [12] If the player allows too much time to pass after doing 
                    this the enemy will flip itself back over and recover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are four enemies which emerge from the pipes: the 
                    Shellcreeper;[13] the Sidestepper;[7] the Fighter Fly,[12] 
                    which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is
                    touching a platform; and the Slipice which turns platforms 
                    into slippery ice.[14] A fifth enemy, fireballs, floats 
                    around 
                    the screen instead of sticking to platforms.
                    [15] The "POW" block will flip all enemies touching a 
                    platform or the floor when activated, but can only be 
                    used three times before disappearing.
                    [14] The game additionally contains bonus rounds.
                    [11] In later rounds, icicles begin to form on the underside 
                    of the platforms and fall off.

                    The arcade game was released in 1983, but there are 
                    conflicting release dates. Game Machine magazine reported 
                    that the game made its North American debut at 
                    the AMOA show during 
                    March 25-27 and entered mass-production in Japan on June 21.
                    [26] The book Arcade TV Game List (2006), authored 
                    by Masumi Akagi and published by the Amusement News Agency, 
                    lists the release dates as March 1983 in North America and 
                    June 1983 in Japan.[27] Former Nintendo president Satoru 
                    Iwata said in a 2013 Nintendo Direct presentation that the 
                    game was first released in Japan on July 6, 1983.[28][29]

                    Upon release, Mario Bros. was initially labeled as 
                    being the third game in the Donkey Kong series. For home
                    video game conversions, Nintendo held the rights to the game
                    in Japan, while licensing the overseas rights to Atari, 
                    Inc.[30]
